# Expript3
This is my customisable programming language, Expript3. There have been two previous versions of Expript3 called Expript and Expript2, but neither of them will be made public. 

## "Programming Langauge"
It is not a programming langauage in the conventional sense, but rather it is an expression evaluator. I have programmed my own operators for this language, including the => operator, which is very similar to the => operator in JavaScript and the lambda keyword in Python. It acts in a very similar way, generating anonymous functions. Since, in conjuction with the <- operator (used for function application), this language can simulate [Lambda Calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_Calculus), it is therefore, [Turing-Complete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness). 

All the other operators are just for a nice time :)
